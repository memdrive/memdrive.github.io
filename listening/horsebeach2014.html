<p>I am not a fan of Horsebeach nor do I listen to their music, but this album has stuck with me and has been replayed many times. 6 of the 10 tracks I really enjoyed, while the other songs were okay or not memorable enough for me to go back and listen to (I marked my favorites with a #). I&#39;ll elaborate on why those stood out after going through the first songs; I want to review the whole album. </p>
<h4>Faded Eyes</h4>
<p>We fade in to a distorted guitar strumming rhythmically alongside a cymbal; transitioning into continued guitar with distorted drums being played slowly. This song is good, but doesn&#39;t change enough, it maintains the same tempo the entire song. The vocals try to raise the songs mood but don&#39;t do enough. &quot;You hide the tears that fall from your faded eyes&quot;, lyrics don&#39;t stand out in anyway. Fade out.</p>
<p>There is no transition between tracks.</p>
<h4>Yesterdays</h4>
<p>Abrupt explosion of several different instruments playing a somber melody. Nothing stands outs.</p>
<h4>Even</h4>
<p>The vocals in this song became annoying to me, I usually skip it; specifically the chorus when Ryan Kennedy says &quot;we are falling further down&quot;.</p>
<h4>A Place Like This</h4>
<p>Okay, now I start to actually enjoy the album a lot. For me to really like a song, I have to feel some emotional reactoin when I listen to it, wether negative or positive. Usually it goes, I feel sad when listening to emotional alternative music, and &quot;good&quot; when I listen to loud trap music. I figure, if this artist was able to get me to feel this emotion with their music, maybe the song is objectibely good in soem way. I don&#39;t know how true this is but I start to dissect the vocals, instruments, lyrics, and subconcious biases I might have of the song. &quot;A Place Like This&quot; makes me sad specifically through the vocals and tone; similar to the opening track we are eventually introduced to a somber horsebeach melody.</p>
<p>But when Kennedy first says, &quot;So why does she pay for their mistakes&quot; it triggers a guitar...</p>
