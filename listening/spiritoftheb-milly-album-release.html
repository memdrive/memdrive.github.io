                    <p id=timestamp>April 9<sup>th</sup>, 2021</p>
                    <p>I really wanted this to be a working SPA React app with, what I was planning to use, the &quot;Universal-Router&quot; router instead of React&#39;s router React Router, because I could save some space, I guess. Aside from that, I decided to focus more on content than functionality; for now this will just be a static page dedicated to the release of &#39;ENTERNTAINMENT, DEATH&#39; and &#39;Wish Goes On&#39;.</p>
                    <p>Today, SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE and Milly release, an album &#39;ENTERNTAINMENT, DEATH&#39; and EP &#39;Wish Goes On&#39; respectively. &#39;ED&#39; is 11 tracks long (3 being previously released singles; 2<sup>nd</sup> track &quot;THERE&#39;S NOTHING YOU CAN&#39;T DO&quot;, 7<sup>th</sup> track &quot;THE SERVER IS IMMERSED&quot;, and 10<sup>th</sup> track &quot;I SUCK THE DEVIL&#39;S COCK&quot;. &#39;WGO&#39; is 5 tracks long (3 also being previously released singles; 2<sup>nd</sup> track &quot;Denial&quot;, 3<sup>rd</sup> track &quot;Star Thistle Blossom&quot;, and 5<sup>th</sup> track &quot;Birds Fly Free&quot;. They&#39;re being grouped together out of convenience; both make alternative indie rock lo-fi more dream pop than shoegaze esque music, they will inevitably release music together, and I listen to both of them. </p>
                    <p>I haven&#39;t listened to either project in its entirety, excluding the previously released singles, but today I get the opportunity to listen to both the same day they are released. I will first listen to &#39;ED&#39; in it&#39;s entirety, then &#39;WGO&#39;, and give my take aways for both projects.</p>I listened to both, they were amazing thank you.</p>
