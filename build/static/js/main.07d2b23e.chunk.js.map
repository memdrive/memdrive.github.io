Aside from that, I decided to focus more on content than functionality; for now this will just be a static page dedicated to the release of &#39;ENTERNTAINMENT, DEATH&#39; and &#39;Wish Goes On&#39;.</p>\n                    <p>Today, SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE and Milly release, an album &#39;ENTERNTAINMENT, DEATH&#39; and EP &#39;Wish Goes On&#39; respectively. &#39;ED&#39; is 11 tracks long (3 being previously released singles; 2<sup>nd</sup> track &quot;THERE&#39;S NOTHING YOU CAN&#39;T DO&quot;, 7<sup>th</sup> track &quot;THE SERVER IS IMMERSED&quot;, and 10<sup>th</sup> track &quot;I SUCK THE DEVIL&#39;S COCK&quot;. &#39;WGO&#39; is 5 tracks long (3 also being previously released singles; 2<sup>nd</sup> track &quot;Denial&quot;, 3<sup>rd</sup> track &quot;Star Thistle Blossom&quot;, and 5<sup>th</sup> track &quot;Birds Fly Free&quot;. They&#39;re being grouped together out of convenience; both make alternative indie rock lo-fi more dream pop than shoegaze esque music, they will inevitably release music together, and I listen to both of them. </p>\n                    <p>I haven&#39;t listened to either project in its entirety, excluding the previously released singles, but today I get the opportunity to listen to both the same day they are released. I will first listen to &#39;ED&#39; in it&#39;s entirety, then &#39;WGO&#39;, and give my take aways for both projects. I listened to both, they were amazing thank you.</p>\n                    \n                    <p id=\"used-links\">Links:</p>\n\n                    <p>[1] : <a href=\"https://www.spiritofthebeehiveband.com\">https://spiritofthebeehiveband.com</a> <br></br>\n                       [2] : <a href=\"https://www.millymusicgroup.com\">https://www.millymusicgroup.com</a></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Listening;","import Root from './components/Root';\nimport Listening from './components/Listening';\n\nimport { Switch, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <Root />\n      <Switch>\n          <Route path=\"/listening\" component={Listening} />\n      </Switch>\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\n\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\n\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Router>\n    <App />\n  </Router>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
